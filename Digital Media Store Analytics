-- For this project, I used a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
-- The database file can be found here: https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country = 'Brazil';

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.employees e

-- Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
